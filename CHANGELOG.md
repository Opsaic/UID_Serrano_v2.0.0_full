### Migration from v5.5.0

1. **Install New Dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

2. **Environment Variables** (Optional - AI features work without these)
   \`\`\`env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
   \`\`\`

3. **Access AI Features**
   - Navigate to `/ai` to access the AI dashboard
   - Chat assistant, document analyzer, insights, and recommendations available

4. **Debug System**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` in development to open debug panel
   - View logs at `/api/debug/logs`
   - Check system health at `/api/debug/health`

### Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backward compatible with v5.5.0. AI features gracefully fall back to mock responses if OpenAI API key is not configured.

### Known Issues

- AI features require OpenAI API key for production use (optional)
- Debug panel only available in development mode
- Document analyzer currently supports text-based documents only
